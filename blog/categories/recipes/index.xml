      <description> This method can be used for cooking any selection of vegetables, the trick is to layer them with the slowest cooking, like green beans, carrots, and other root veg at the bottom of the pan, and the faster cooking, like broccoli, cabbage and spinach on top. A layer of sliced onions in the bottom of the pan melts down and steams the veg above.
Ingredients  Sliced onions Potatoes Carrots Whatever green veg is to hand Olive oil  Method  Cover the bottom of a medium saucepan with oil Place a layer of sliced onions on the bottom Layer sliced carrots, potatoes, and green veg in the pan Put on a low heat for about 20 minutes with the lid on until the veg is cooked to taste  </description>

      <description>This is from a transport caff near the village of Pissouri, Cyprus many years ago. The pods need to be picked before the beans have fully developed and before the pods have grown a tough membrane around the beans. I have not seen beans this young for sale.
Ingredients  Young broad bean pods, Olive oil  Method  Wash and trim the bean pods and put in a suitably sized saucepan Add a glug of olive oil, cover and place on a low heat for about 10 minutes or so The pods will become soft and possibly brown a little depending on the heat  The transport caff served a bowl of these as a meal in it&amp;#8217;s own right.</description>

      <description>Back in the mid 70&amp;#8217;s, I had to do some work at Kingston upon Thames Power Station. When I stopped for lunch, I found a little Greek restaurant opposite in a parade of shops and restaurants. That whole area, including the power station has since been redeveloped, and bears no resemblance. I had their lunch time offer of pan fried kidneys, probably with rice.
When I got home, I mentioned this to she who did most of the cooking at that time and she came up with something which became her kidney special.</description>

      <description>This recipe is based on the mutton in a pot in this episode of Italy Unpacked. I have converted it to a slow cooker recipe, but it could be done in a casserole in the oven or in a earthenware pot next to a wood fire. Some of the ingredients are a compromise, for example Giorgio bought a kilo of rocket in the market. I couldn&amp;#8217;t have got all that in the pot.</description>

      <description>unob·ta·ni·um (unob-tayn-ium)
Ingredient not available on the shelf at your local major supermarket.
If you attempt to use any celebrity or TV chef recipe, you will find at least one ingredient is unobtainable locally. You will also find a healthy disregard of the cleaning up operation afterwards. Usually most of this nonsense can be safely ignored and locally available ingredients used instead, and the recipe converted from an N-pot recipe to a one-pot recipe.</description>

      <description>When I was a teenager the chippy at Preston, Weymouth, Dorset used to serve faggots and peas with gravy in those aluminium foil containers that take-away Chinese used to come in. Enough for 2.
Ingredients  3-5 faggots Frozen or fresh peas Truly Evil Onion Gravy  Method  Start the gravy first as it takes a while to render the onions down. Once the onions are well done, put the faggots in a tin and place in a medium hot oven &amp;#8211; 180° C, util they are starting to brown.</description>

      <description>This is an adaptation of a recipe I saw recently in the Metro. Not Huevos Rancheros, but something else. The original recipe was most insistent that the black pepper be added to the pan, not the eggs, and the eggs should be stirred, not beaten.
