      <description>If you write an android app that handles images or any other sort of file your app may be required to deal with &amp;#8216;content&amp;#8217; uris (content://). There is a very useful utility which resolves these into &amp;#8216;file&amp;#8217; uris (file:///) FileUtils.java. This contains one external reference to LocalStorageProvider, which can be resolved by replacing the reference with a string.
// import com.ianhanniballake.localstorage.LocalStorageProvider; // ... /** * @param uri The Uri to check.</description>

      <description>Two articles, Handling Runtime Changes and Two articles, Handling Runtime Changes and recommend the use of fragments to retain data and background tasks in Android during the life of an app. There are two problems with this:
 An android fragment is quite a complex heavyweight object to use just for retaining data and possibly a background task, and the fragment management is not simple. Fragments are not retained if the associated activity is discarded by calling finish().</description>

      <title>Using Emacs as an IDE</title>

      <description>I had to learn Emacs on Unix many years ago as it was at that time the only development environment for Smallworld Magik. Having learnt it, I have stuck with it as it provides a consistent platform for editing source code and building applications in as many computer languages and platforms as I have used and many more I haven&amp;#8217;t. It is the only source code editor I have used that always gets the indentation and syntax highlighting right.</description>

      <description>I got myself a refurbished Moto G phone a while ago. It came with Android Kitkat 4.4.4, complete with Moto bloat. I had already put Cyanogenmod on my tablet, so I installed Cyanogenmod 11, android 4.4.4 on it, in accordance with the instructions on the wiki, no problem. That got rid of the bloat and allows fine control of app snooping via Privacy Guard in the settings.
When I first installed Cyanogenmod, I had to use an unofficial build, as an official build for Kitkat 4.</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;#8217;t like the Windows 10 preview, I thought it was a pain in the backside, so I have delayed upgrading from Windows 7 until the last minute when I got the countdown notification. I have been running a slightly dodgy copy of Windows 7 for a long time, so I was somewhat surprised when, out of the goodness of their hearts, Microsoft said I could have an activated copy of Windows 10 for free.</description>

      <description>When I got fed up with Windows XP on my netbook, I tried windows 7 on it, but it was barely usable. So I tried Windows 7 Starter which was better. I upgraded it to Home Premium, which was OK at first, but slowed down as it got clagged up with updates.
That was it until recently, when I read an article about putting Windows 10 on one. I didn&amp;#8217;t try that, but I did try Linux Mint on it.</description>

      <description>You will need to install the Xcode command line tools, you don&amp;#8217;t need the Xcode app. The easiest way to do this is to attempt to build an app like emacs by typing ./configure on the command line. A dialog box will pop up asking if you want to download and install the tools.
Xcode now uses the LLVM CLang compiler and documentation is exceedingly hard to find. You can type gcc -help or clang -help on the command line to get some info.</description>

      <description>You will need to install Calibre to make the books usable, and the books must be DRM free.
There are two ways to do this:
 If you have a Mac or Hackintosh you can find your books in ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks/Books, in what appears to be epub files but are really folders with numeric names. Copy the ones you want to somewhere accessible, like ~/Books, and zip the contents of each folder, not the folder itself.</description>

      <description>I recently added a new disk drive to my workstation and, as part of reorganising, wanted to move the Linux Mint root partition from one disk to another. Naturally I googled duckied it and found a certain amount of useful info.
I used gnuparted to copy the partition from one disk to another. The standard method to reinstall grub on a partition so it will boot appears to be to mount it and use grub-install with the &amp;#8211;boot-directory option like this.</description>

      <description>Using a handler to return results from a worker thread This has taken me quite a while to put together. There are throw-away remarks in the Android docs about this, but no useful examples. You want to get the results back from a worker thread to your main activity so you can do stuff with them. There are several parts to this.
 The main activity implements Handler.Callback, and has a handleMessage function.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;#8217;t worried too much about search engines since I set this site up. I registered it with Google initially, and after a few days it appeared in the results, so that was good enough for me. If you search for Old Shoreham Buccaneers, or a subset of that, the Buccaneers site appears high in the results, job done.
Since I published a recipe based on the BBC TV programme Italy Unpacked about a month ago, I have been getting a lot of hits on the Recipes page.</description>

      <title>Fast Fourier Transform</title>

      <description>I wrote a java tuner app a few years ago, so I needed a Fast Fourier Transform to do the frequency detection. I found a fairly simple implementation in java on the web somewhere, can&amp;#8217;t remember where, tried it, and it worked fine. The frequency detection algorithm comes from The Dsp Dimension.
A few years later I ported it to windows, added a few gizmos for tuning accordions and put it on Google Code.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been using an old iPhone 3G, and I&amp;#8217;ve got myself a new Android phone. First off, I googled DuckDuckGo&amp;#8216;d how to transfer my contacts and found lots of suggestions. First, I tried My Contacts Backup, but it wouldn&amp;#8217;t install on the iPhone.
So I synced the contacts with my Hackintosh using iTunes, exported the contacts to a vCard file, transferred it to the phone by email and imported the file to the Contacts app on the phone.</description>

      <description>I made a vow about 20 years ago not to attempt to learn C++, when a colleague went on a C++ course. I did buy a C++ book, but it wasn&amp;#8217;t that useful. I have looked at the source of various C++ programs over the years to attempt to find out how they worked. I have, until recently, invariably found that the code that does something useful is either hidden in include files, or buried so deep in obscure code that just seems to create and do strange things with various objects, that I have been unable to find it.</description>

      <description>I find Java Collections frustrating and insane. I have been through this loop on several occasions. I decide I want a list to do whatever. So I look up List in the docs and find it&amp;#8217;s an interface, ie: roll yer own. So I look down the hierarchy and find AbstractList, which is abstract, again: roll yer own. So finally I get to ArrayList which might do the job, but the docs aren&amp;#8217;t too clear, so I try it and it works.</description>

      <guid>http://billthefarmer.github.io/blog/download-streamed-video/</guid>
      <description>Online video providers tend to stream the video to a javascript player, so making it extremely difficult to capture the video. This blog explains a method using Chrome to spoof the user agent string, pretending to be an iPad. Unfortunately, this doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to work any more in the latest version of Chrome.
So I tried installing a user agent spoofing plugin in Firefox. It seemed to work, but the video didn&amp;#8217;t play, so I couldn&amp;#8217;t find the url.</description>

      <guid>http://billthefarmer.github.io/blog/concurrency-threads-semaphores-and-mutexes/</guid>
      <description>I have written several applications in both Java and C that involve running an audio thread in the background to read or write audio from or to the audio system while displaying the results and interacting with the user in the foreground. I have used lots of threads, but never a semaphore or mutex apart from the odd boolean variable.
This issue is reminiscent of back in the day when you actually had or could get a circuit diagram of your computer and could understand it.</description>

      <description>This site has the firewall set up so that the web server has no external access. This means that I can&amp;#8217;t use the usual WordPress update mechanism to keep it up to date. I use FileZilla for maintaining the server, and I recently discovered you can use drag and drop to move stuff around remotely.
So my easy WordPress upgrade method is:
 Download the latest zip file and unzip it.</description>

      <description>I read an article recently about how amazingly efficient functional programming, and Haskell in particular is. So I thought I&amp;#8217;s give it a go and see how I got on.
You can try it out in your browser: http://tryhaskell.org

      <description>When I first set up this web site, I looked for a simple web analytics program so that I could see if anyone actually looked at it. After faffing about with a couple of well known open source packages, I decided that they were way over the top by several orders of magnitude. Then I found SlimStat. However it appears to be no longer actively maintained, which it why the previous link is via the Way Back Machine.</description>

      <description>When I got my Pi some months ago I bought a wifi adapter for it, as you do. But I couldn&amp;#8217;t get it to work reliably in Raspbian, and I didn&amp;#8217;t even try in Arch Linux. So I tested the adapter on my windoze box, and it worked just fine, and I tried it with Linux and it worked just fine, so I put it in the &amp;#8216;too hard&amp;#8217; box.</description>

      <guid>http://billthefarmer.github.io/blog/python/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve studiously avoided Python up till now, even though it appears to be fairly popular, because it violates the first law of compiler design: &amp;#8216;Blank space shalt not be significant except to separate tokens where necessary.&amp;#8217;. That&amp;#8217;s why you can minimise a lengthy JavaScript script like [jQuery][1] to one enormously long line and it still works just fine.
But, she-who-shall-be-ignored (self categorisation) decided she wanted to enter an advent calender competition which involved checking a web page to see if your name has come up and sending an email if it does.</description>
