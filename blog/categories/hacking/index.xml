      <description>Android versions from android 5 use a Toolbar as the ActionBar, but there appears to be no obvious API access.&#xA;However, by traversing the view hierarchy, it can be found and used to set up app navigation.&#xA;Create a recursive function to traverse the views and find the toolbar.&#xA;// findToolbar private Toolbar findToolbar(ViewGroup group) { View result = null; final int count = group.getChildCount(); for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; count; i++) { View view = group.</description>

      <description>Android app widgets normally can be set up to update periodically, but not repeatedly for a short period. For a bus times app I need the widget to update every 30 seconds for about 5 minutes.&#xA;I already had a Service set up to update the widget from a suitable web site and using a Handler to reset the progress bar if the background update process failed.&#xA;public static final int RESET_DELAY = 5 * 1000; public static final int REPEAT_DELAY = 30 * 1000; public static final int STOP_DELAY = 5 * 60 * 1000; private Handler handler; private boolean stopUpdate; // onCreate @Override public void onCreate() { // Get handler handler = new Handler(Looper.</description>

      <description>A popular online puzzle game involves solving a five character word grid in the least number of moves. There are probably several ways of algorithmically generating word grids, Donald Knuth&amp;rsquo;s Dancing Links paper mentions generating a word grid. I decided to use brute force and a randomised word list.&#xA;This uses a large number of lists and iterators and can generate a large number of word grids. This algorithm is used in my Gridle android app.</description>

      <description>Most mainstream newspapers show a teaser front page on their web site, but hide most of their content behind a paywall. As with most things you can think of, there is a browser extension for this – Bypass Paywalls.&#xA;However this does not work for all newspapers, the extension appears to have dropped support for The Times, for example. It is still possible to read some articles by making use of a search engine to find another source for the text of the item.</description>

      <description>Google have made a big thing of their flutter development platform, so I thought I ought to give it a try. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to install, just download the sdk, unzip it in a suitable place and add the bin folder to your path.&#xA;Update I decided to have another look as it appears to be liked by developers on Reddit. The old version wouldn&amp;rsquo;t update, so I downloaded the latest (Flutter 3.</description>

      <description>All my android apps have up until now been written in Java, avoiding the use of the support libraries or androidx. The Google developers docs and guides advocate the use of Kotlin rather than Java and the use of androidx almost to the exclusion of the standard android API.&#xA;I have a very simple app, Oglaf, NS(Generally)FW, which is just a wrapper around the web site, with some navigation. So I decided to convert it to Kotlin, just to see how difficult it was and to see what effect, if any, it had on the app.</description>

      <description>I was asked to add a word and character count to my Editor app. So I looked it up and found a Gist that uses BreakIterator. This relies on an embedded function that determines what is considered a word.&#xA;So I tested it and found that it gave different results to the linux utility wc. However, the app already makes great use of regular expressions, which include an expression for a word character \w.</description>

      <description>This has been superceded by youtube-dl, which seems to work on most video sites.&#xA;Since I wrote Download streamed video video web sites have upped their game to stop downloading. One of the techniques used is to use a M3U playlist and a complicated set of parameters. Other techniques are to use JavaScript to create a blob and play that, and to use a JavaScript browser app which goes into debug mode if you use the developer tools.</description>

      <description>Back in the late 90&amp;rsquo;s I wrote an simulation app for an old telecontrol system that was being superceded. It was written in Turbo C to run on a DOS or Win95 PC.&#xA;The app used a conio library provided by the compiler to present colour character text and graphics on a monitor using a standard PC keyboard.&#xA;It used to run under 32 bit windows but wouldn&amp;rsquo;t run under 64 bit windows as there is no DOS emulation.</description>

      <description>Lambda expressions or anonymous functions can be quite useful. For example using jQuery in JavaScript all the work gets done in anonymous functions unless you particularly want to extract them and give them names&amp;hellip;&#xA;jQuery(document).ready(function($) { // ... // Process the start button $(&amp;#34;#start&amp;#34;).click(function() { question = 0; $(&amp;#34;#data&amp;#34;).css(&amp;#34;display&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;none&amp;#34;); $(&amp;#34;.intro&amp;#34;).fadeOut(function() { // Do stuff }); // ... }); }); In C++ the syntax is curious in that there are a pair of square brackets enclosing &amp;lsquo;captured&amp;rsquo; variables&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>My Diary and Notes apps have a floating button in the corner of the screen which is used to switch between editing markdown text and viewing the result. Although it is part of the android Material Design, this button has been the subject of several issues raised by users.&#xA;I have seen apps which hide this button on scrolling, and this was one of the suggestions by users. Getting this to work correctly turned out to be more complex than initially considered, requiring two boolean flags and a lambda expression.</description>

      <description>I had a request to switch to the edit view from the markdown view at the double tap position in my Diary app. The app already has a gesture detector so I just had to add an onDoubleTap function.&#xA;To get the tap position in the markdown view it is necessary to compensate for the position of the view on the screen, scrolling, and the display density.&#xA;// onDoubleTap @Override public boolean onDoubleTap(MotionEvent e) { if (shown) { int[] l = new int[2]; markdownView.</description>

      <description>Pi-hole I came across a reference to Pi-hole recently, so as my old pi has been gathering dust, I thought I would try it out. The pi already had Raspbian Stretch Lite installed, so I uninstalled some of the packages I had previously installed, and loaded Pi-Hole using the One-Step Automated Install.&#xA;The installation script asks a series of questions using text dialogs and produces a log as it goes.</description>

      <description>One of the enhancements suggested for my android editor is syntax highlighting. The libraries I have found, including the one used in this blog, parse the input and produce output in HTML, using styled spans. Emacs makes extensive use of regular expressions for highlighting.&#xA;HTML output is not very useful for a text editor. It could be used with Html.fromHtml() to produce styled text. This would then be loaded back into the editor all while the user is attempting to edit the text.</description>

      <description>A musical staff is not a trivial thing to draw because of the complex curves needed for the treble and bass clef.

      <description>When editing data or source files it would be useful to have selections triggered by a double tap or long press expand to enclosing delimiters or brackets.&#xA;There is a section in the Android docs which explains how to set up your own context menu or contextual action mode, but not how to change the selection.&#xA;This method is fine if you have only one text editor view in your app, but would be difficult with more than one as there is no way to identify the originating view.</description>

      <description>Introduction As part of the Questionnaire Maker plugin it is necessary to create a pdf report. The best tool to do this appears to be TCPDF, which appears to be part of at least some Linux distributions as php-tcpdf. It is not included in WordPress.&#xA;Implementation As both the plugin and TCPDF are hosted on GitHub, the best way to implement the plugin, and TCPDF if it is not available on the web server, is to clone the repositories and use symbolic links to provide the plugin and the library in the right places.</description>

The shortcode will be replaced on the page with a series of panels containing the questions and options for the answers, or a panel with a preview of the report.</description>

      <description>I have a windows app where I want the app window to maintain it&amp;rsquo;s aspect ratio when it is resized. Windows provides two mechanisms for this, the WM_SIZE message and the WM_SIZING message. The WM_SIZE message is sent when a window has been resized to allow child windows to be resized, the WM_SIZING message is sent while the user is resizing it to allow the size to be adjusted. The messages are handled in the WindowProc callback function.</description>

However the docs, although they show you how to set it up, don&amp;rsquo;t explain how it works. To find that out, I had to look at the various threads on the Hugo forums.&#xA;There are four parts - you need to create a new partial template in layouts/partials/related.html containing something like this:</description>

      <description>I wrote the whatever-o-meter about five years ago in PHP and Javascript as a Wordpress plugin. As I have migrated my blog to Hugo, I thought to have a go at reimplementing it. The exporter I used made a good job of translating the Wordpress custom fields to Hugo front matter parameters. I had to put dashes in quotes, otherwise they get interpreted as [&amp;lt;nil&amp;gt;].&#xA;intro: Please answer the following questions carefully and truthfully.</description>

      <description>I have got fed up with Wordpress. It required constant updates, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t work automatically on Sourceforge developer web, and it&amp;rsquo;s slow, especially in admin mode. I came across a reference to Hugo while following up on something unrelated, so I decided to investigate.&#xA;I looked for migration tools, and found two:&#xA;Exitwp, which reads a Wordpress export xml file and converts to Jeckyll WordPress to Hugo Exporter, which is a Wordpress plugin and exports to Hugo I found a blog post from Justin Dunham documenting migrating his blog.</description>

      <description>If you write an android app that handles images or any other sort of file your app may be required to deal with ‘content’ uris (content://). There is a very useful utility which resolves these into ‘file’ uris (file:///) FileUtils.java. This contains one external reference to LocalStorageProvider, which can be resolved by removing the function isLocalStorageDocument() and references to it.&#xA;// import com.ianhanniballake.localstorage.LocalStorageProvider; // ... /** * @param uri The Uri to check.</description>

      <description>Two articles, Handling Configuration Changes and Handling Configuration Changes with Fragments recommend the use of fragments to retain data and background tasks in Android during the life of an app. There are two problems with this:&#xA;An android fragment is quite a complex heavyweight object to use just for retaining data and possibly a background task, and the fragment management is not simple. Fragments are not retained if the associated activity is discarded by calling finish().</description>

      <description>I had to learn Emacs on Unix many years ago as it was at that time the only development environment for Smallworld Magik. Having learnt it, I have stuck with it as it provides a consistent platform for editing source code and building applications in as many computer languages and platforms as I have used and many more I haven’t. It is the only source code editor I have used that always gets the indentation and syntax highlighting right.</description>

      <description>I got myself a refurbished Moto G phone a while ago. It came with Android Kitkat 4.4.4, complete with Moto bloat. I had already put Cyanogenmod on my tablet, so I installed Cyanogenmod 11, android 4.4.4 on it, in accordance with the instructions on the wiki, no problem. That got rid of the bloat and allows fine control of app snooping via Privacy Guard in the settings.&#xA;When I first installed Cyanogenmod, I had to use an unofficial build, as an official build for Kitkat 4.</description>

      <description>I didn’t like the Windows 10 preview, I thought it was a pain in the backside, so I have delayed upgrading from Windows 7 until the last minute when I got the countdown notification. I have been running a slightly dodgy copy of Windows 7 for a long time, so I was somewhat surprised when, out of the goodness of their hearts, Microsoft said I could have an activated copy of Windows 10 for free.</description>

      <description>When I got fed up with Windows XP on my netbook, I tried windows 7 on it, but it was barely usable. So I tried Windows 7 Starter which was better. I upgraded it to Home Premium, which was OK at first, but slowed down as it got clagged up with updates.&#xA;That was it until recently, when I read an article about putting Windows 10 on one. I didn’t try that, but I did try Linux Mint on it.</description>

      <description>You will need to install the Xcode command line tools, you don’t need the Xcode app. The easiest way to do this is to attempt to build an app like emacs by typing ./configure on the command line. A dialog box will pop up asking if you want to download and install the tools.&#xA;Xcode now uses the LLVM CLang compiler and documentation is exceedingly hard to find. You can type gcc -help or clang -help on the command line to get some info.</description>

      <description>You will need to install Calibre to make the books usable, and the books must be DRM free.&#xA;There are two ways to do this:&#xA;If you have a Mac or Hackintosh you can find your books in ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks/Books, in what appears to be epub files but are really folders with numeric names. Copy the ones you want to somewhere accessible, like ~/Books, and zip the contents of each folder, not the folder itself.</description>

      <description>I recently added a new disk drive to my workstation and, as part of reorganising, wanted to move the Linux Mint root partition from one disk to another. Naturally I googled duckied it and found a certain amount of useful info.&#xA;I used gnuparted to copy the partition from one disk to another. The standard method to reinstall grub on a partition so it will boot appears to be to mount it and use grub-install with the –boot-directory option like this.</description>

      <description>Using a handler to return results from a worker thread This has taken me quite a while to put together. There are throw-away remarks in the Android docs about this, but no useful examples. You want to get the results back from a worker thread to your main activity so you can do stuff with them. There are several parts to this.&#xA;The main activity implements Handler.Callback, and has a handleMessage function.</description>

      <description>I wrote a java tuner app a few years ago, so I needed a Fast Fourier Transform to do the frequency detection. I found a fairly simple implementation in java on the web somewhere, can’t remember where, tried it, and it worked fine. The frequency detection algorithm comes from The Dsp Dimension.&#xA;A few years later I ported it to windows, added a few gizmos for tuning accordions and put it on Google Code.</description>

      <description>I’ve been using an old iPhone 3G, and I’ve got myself a new Android phone. First off, I googled DuckDuckGo’d how to transfer my contacts and found lots of suggestions. First, I tried My Contacts Backup, but it wouldn’t install on the iPhone.&#xA;So I synced the contacts with my Hackintosh using iTunes, exported the contacts to a vCard file, transferred it to the phone by email and imported the file to the Contacts app on the phone.</description>

      <description>I made a vow about 20 years ago not to attempt to learn C++, when a colleague went on a C++ course. I did buy a C++ book, but it wasn’t that useful. I have looked at the source of various C++ programs over the years to attempt to find out how they worked. I have, until recently, invariably found that the code that does something useful is either hidden in include files, or buried so deep in obscure code that just seems to create and do strange things with various objects, that I have been unable to find it.</description>

      <description>I find Java Collections frustrating and insane. I have been through this loop on several occasions. I decide I want a list to do whatever. So I look up List in the docs and find it’s an interface, ie: roll yer own. So I look down the hierarchy and find AbstractList, which is abstract, again: roll yer own. So finally I get to ArrayList which might do the job, but the docs aren’t too clear, so I try it and it works.</description>

      <description>Online video providers tend to stream the video to a javascript player, so making it extremely difficult to capture the video. This blog explains a method using Chrome to spoof the user agent string, pretending to be an iPad. Unfortunately, this doesn’t seem to work any more in the latest version of Chrome.&#xA;So I tried installing a user agent spoofing plugin in Firefox. It seemed to work, but the video didn’t play, so I couldn’t find the url.</description>

      <description>I have written several applications in both Java and C that involve running an audio thread in the background to read or write audio from or to the audio system while displaying the results and interacting with the user in the foreground. I have used lots of threads, but never a semaphore or mutex apart from the odd boolean variable.&#xA;This issue is reminiscent of back in the day when you actually had or could get a circuit diagram of your computer and could understand it.</description>

      <description>This site has the firewall set up so that the web server has no external access. This means that I can’t use the usual WordPress update mechanism to keep it up to date. I use FileZilla for maintaining the server, and I recently discovered you can use drag and drop to move stuff around remotely.&#xA;So my easy WordPress upgrade method is:&#xA;Download the latest zip file and unzip it. Rename the wordpress folder to something else, like wordpress-old.</description>

However it appears to be no longer actively maintained, which it why the previous link is via the Way Back Machine.</description>

      <description>I’ve studiously avoided Python up till now, even though it appears to be fairly popular, because it violates the first law of compiler design: ‘Blank space shalt not be significant except to separate tokens where necessary.’. That’s why you can minimise a lengthy JavaScript script like jQuery to one enormously long line and it still works just fine.&#xA;But, she-who-shall-be-ignored (self categorisation) decided she wanted to enter an advent calender competition which involved checking a web page to see if your name has come up and sending an email if it does.</description>

The project is on Github.&#xA;Documentation Whatever-o-meter uses the shortcode [whatever-o-meter] or {{&amp;lt;whatever-o-meter&amp;gt;}} to insert the whatever-o-meter display into the page.</description>
