      <description>There are two things that seem to go wrong with pop up basin waste plugs, either the clicker stops working or the O ring washer fails.
Clicker The clicker can stay stuck down, refuse to stay down or come apart.
If it sticks down it can possibly be pulled back up with a drain plunger, otherwise you will need to take off the U bend and poke it back up with a long screwdriver.</description>

      <description>My heating system uses 1/4â€³ copper pipe, which I think was called microbore at the time. Both pipes went to a valve at one end of the radiator. There were a variety of valves fitted, but most of them were like this one.
I investigated the best method for replacing the radiators and valves and found that using standard 15mm fittings with 15/8mm reducers was probably the best option. This involves removing the old radiator and valve, carefully removing the olives from the existing pipes with a junior hacksaw to cut a slot, and a screwdriver to pry it off.</description>
