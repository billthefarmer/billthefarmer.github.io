      <description>My heating system uses 1&amp;frasl;4&amp;#8243; copper pipe, which I think was called micro-bore at the time. Both pipes went to a valve at one end of the radiator. There were a variety of valves fitted, but most of them were like this one.
I investigated the best method for replacing the radiators and valves and found that using standard 15mm fittings with 15/8mm reducers was probably the best option. This involves removing the old radiator and valve, carefully removing the olives from the existing pipes with a junior hacksaw to cut a slot, and a screwdriver to pry it off.</description>
