<p>Back in the mid 70&#8217;s, I had to do some work at Kingston upon Thames Power Station. When I stopped for lunch, I found a little Greek restaurant opposite in a parade of shops and restaurants. That whole area, including the power station has since been redeveloped, and bears no resemblance. I had their lunch time offer of pan fried kidneys, probably with rice.</p>

<p>When I got home, I mentioned this to she who did most of the cooking at that time and she came up with something which became her kidney special. It evolved into a completely different dish over time.</p>

<p>I looked for some lamb&#8217;s kidneys in the co-op today, but ended up with liver instead. A tasty meal for two.</p>

<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>Approx 240g sliced lamb&#8217;s liver</li>
<li>A couple of rashers of streaky or cooking bacon</li>
<li>Approx 50g of sliced chorizo</li>
<li>An onion, sliced</li>
<li>Olive oil for cooking</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="method">Method</h2>

<ol>
<li>Cover the bottom of a large skillet or frying pan with oil and place onion slices in the pan.</li>
<li>Cook on a low heat until softened and starting to brown and turn over.</li>
<li>Place the slices of liver on top and arrange the bacon and chorizo around the liver.</li>
<li>Cover and cook on the low heat until the liver is nearly cooked through.</li>
<li>Turn the slices of liver over, and cook for another minute or so.</li>
<li>Serve with mashed potato or rice.</li>
</ol>
