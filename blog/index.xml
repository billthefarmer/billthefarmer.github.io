      <description>Android versions from android 5 use a Toolbar as the ActionBar, but there appears to be no obvious API access.&#xA;However, by traversing the view hierarchy, it can be found and used to set up app navigation.&#xA;Create a recursive function to traverse the views and find the toolbar.&#xA;// findToolbar private Toolbar findToolbar(ViewGroup group) { View result = null; final int count = group.getChildCount(); for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; count; i++) { View view = group.</description>

      <description>Android app widgets normally can be set up to update periodically, but not repeatedly for a short period. For a bus times app I need the widget to update every 30 seconds for about 5 minutes.&#xA;I already had a Service set up to update the widget from a suitable web site and using a Handler to reset the progress bar if the background update process failed.&#xA;public static final int RESET_DELAY = 5 * 1000; public static final int REPEAT_DELAY = 30 * 1000; public static final int STOP_DELAY = 5 * 60 * 1000; private Handler handler; private boolean stopUpdate; // onCreate @Override public void onCreate() { // Get handler handler = new Handler(Looper.</description>

      <description>Our neighbour has been giving us large kale–like leaves from his purple sprouting broccoli plants, which are quite tasty. I decided to look up what could be done with large cabbage leaves and decided on wraps with a tomato sauce over the top.&#xA;Ingredients 250g minced turkey thigh An onion, finely chopped A garlic clove, crushed A carrot, grated 50g porridge oats Small stick of celery, chopped A mushroom, chopped finely An egg Black pepper Olive oil Enough cabbage leaves for six wraps A jar of pasta sauce or tin of chopped tomatoes Grated cheese for topping Method Cut the tough stems out of the leaves and cook them gently in just enough water until limp enough to wrap around the ingredients.</description>

      <title>Create a Word Grid</title>

      <guid>https://billthefarmer.github.io/blog/create-word-grid/</guid>
      <description>A popular online puzzle game involves solving a five character word grid in the least number of moves. There are probably several ways of algorithmically generating word grids, Donald Knuth&amp;rsquo;s Dancing Links paper mentions generating a word grid. I decided to use brute force and a randomised word list.&#xA;This uses a large number of lists and iterators and can generate a large number of word grids. This algorithm is used in my Gridle android app.</description>

      <description>Most mainstream newspapers show a teaser front page on their web site, but hide most of their content behind a paywall. As with most things you can think of, there is a browser extension for this – Bypass Paywalls.&#xA;However this does not work for all newspapers, the extension appears to have dropped support for The Times, for example. It is still possible to read some articles by making use of a search engine to find another source for the text of the item.</description>

      <description>This is not authentic Risotto Milanese, that requires beef marrow and saffron. I refuse to pay the exotic prices demanded for saffron in the UK, and I don&amp;rsquo;t have any beef marrow.&#xA;Lunch for two.&#xA;Ingredients Olive oil Butter, small knob 3/4 cup arborio rice Medium onion, chopped finely Mushrooms, chopped, if liked Chicken stock pot 1/2 teaspoon turmeric Boiling water, about 1 1/4 cups Cheddar cheese, grated Method Add the knob of butter to a medium heavy bottomed pan, add a good glug of olive oil and place on a low heat.</description>

      <description>Google have made a big thing of their flutter development platform, so I thought I ought to give it a try. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to install, just download the sdk, unzip it in a suitable place and add the bin folder to your path.&#xA;Update I decided to have another look as it appears to be liked by developers on Reddit. The old version wouldn&amp;rsquo;t update, so I downloaded the latest (Flutter 3.</description>

      <description>All my android apps have up until now been written in Java, avoiding the use of the support libraries or androidx. The Google developers docs and guides advocate the use of Kotlin rather than Java and the use of androidx almost to the exclusion of the standard android API.&#xA;I have a very simple app, Oglaf, NS(Generally)FW, which is just a wrapper around the web site, with some navigation. So I decided to convert it to Kotlin, just to see how difficult it was and to see what effect, if any, it had on the app.</description>

      <title>Android Word Count</title>

      <guid>https://billthefarmer.github.io/blog/word-count/</guid>
      <description>I was asked to add a word and character count to my Editor app. So I looked it up and found a Gist that uses BreakIterator. This relies on an embedded function that determines what is considered a word.&#xA;So I tested it and found that it gave different results to the linux utility wc. However, the app already makes great use of regular expressions, which include an expression for a word character \w.</description>

      <description>Many years ago, in a hotel in Hollywood, we thought the breakfast was a bit overpriced. Someone suggested the Dunkin&amp;rsquo; Donut across the road, so over we went. In there the guy was offering bacon, egg over easy, and hash brown for 99¢. I was intrigued with the hash brown, he just took a handful of grated potato from a plastic bag and chucked it on the griddle plate.&#xA;Ingredients Grated potato Vegetable cooking oil Method Put some cooking oil in a hot medium sized skillet Grate your potatoes and put them in the pan Cook until browned underneath and turn over Serve when browned on the reverse side Goes extremely well with bacon and eggs and the trimmings.</description>

      <description>This is an adaptation of a recipe by our daughter&amp;rsquo;s Australian fiancee. His version was a way of getting vegetables into his kids by hiding them in meat sauce. This adaptation uses meatballs instead of mince.&#xA;Ingredients Meatballs Tomatoes, chopped Tomato paste Olive oil Oregano Onions, chopped Garlic, chopped Carrots, chopped Celery, chopped Cabbage, chopped Fusilli pasta Method Fry or cook the meatballs in the oven, keeping them warm. Make a tomato and vegetable sauce with the olive oil, tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano and vegetables.</description>

      <description>Meatballs are sometimes on offer at our local supermarket, so what can you do with them apart from meatball curry or meatballs with spaghetti? What about swedish meatballs? Well we didn&amp;rsquo;t like the sound of the creamy gravy or sauce they are supposed to be served with and decided that Truly Evil Onion Gravy was the way to go.&#xA;Ingredients Meatballs Frozen or fresh peas Truly Evil Onion Gravy Method Start the gravy first as it takes a while to render the onions down.</description>

      <description>This has been superceded by youtube-dl, which seems to work on most video sites.&#xA;Since I wrote Download streamed video video web sites have upped their game to stop downloading. One of the techniques used is to use a M3U playlist and a complicated set of parameters. Other techniques are to use JavaScript to create a blob and play that, and to use a JavaScript browser app which goes into debug mode if you use the developer tools.</description>

      <description>Back in the late 90&amp;rsquo;s I wrote an simulation app for an old telecontrol system that was being superceded. It was written in Turbo C to run on a DOS or Win95 PC.&#xA;The app used a conio library provided by the compiler to present colour character text and graphics on a monitor using a standard PC keyboard.&#xA;It used to run under 32 bit windows but wouldn&amp;rsquo;t run under 64 bit windows as there is no DOS emulation.</description>

      <description>Lambda expressions or anonymous functions can be quite useful.

      <description>This cake is delicious, quick and easy to make.The amount of sugar is reduced because the banana has natural sweetness. I have substituted rapeseed oil for cooking margarine as it is a healthier option. Using this method you do not need a food processor.&#xA;Ingredients 225g (8oz) self raising flour 1 level teaspoon baking powder 55g (2oz) demerara sugar 2 large ripe bananas 55g (2oz) walnut pieces 55g (2oz) sultanas 2 eggs 2 tablespoons rapeseed oil milk to mix 20cm cake tin (or similar)</description>

      <description>My Diary and Notes apps have a floating button in the corner of the screen which is used to switch between editing markdown text and viewing the result. Although it is part of the android Material Design, this button has been the subject of several issues raised by users.&#xA;I have seen apps which hide this button on scrolling, and this was one of the suggestions by users. Getting this to work correctly turned out to be more complex than initially considered, requiring two boolean flags and a lambda expression.</description>

      <description>I had a request to switch to the edit view from the markdown view at the double tap position in my Diary app. The app already has a gesture detector so I just had to add an onDoubleTap function.&#xA;To get the tap position in the markdown view it is necessary to compensate for the position of the view on the screen, scrolling, and the display density.&#xA;// onDoubleTap @Override public boolean onDoubleTap(MotionEvent e) { if (shown) { int[] l = new int[2]; markdownView.</description>

      <description>One of the enhancements suggested for my android editor is syntax highlighting. The libraries I have found, including the one used in this blog, parse the input and produce output in HTML, using styled spans. Emacs makes extensive use of regular expressions for highlighting.&#xA;HTML output is not very useful for a text editor. It could be used with Html.fromHtml() to produce styled text. This would then be loaded back into the editor all while the user is attempting to edit the text.</description>

      <description>When editing data or source files it would be useful to have selections triggered by a double tap or long press expand to enclosing delimiters or brackets.&#xA;There is a section in the Android docs which explains how to set up your own context menu or contextual action mode, but not how to change the selection.&#xA;This method is fine if you have only one text editor view in your app, but would be difficult with more than one as there is no way to identify the originating view.</description>

      <description>If you grow your own tomatoes outside you will end up with green ones that aren&amp;rsquo;t going to ripen up anytime soon. The classic method for using them up is to make Green Tomato Chutney, which is quite easy. If the skins are tough, use a blender to liquidise them.&#xA;Green Tomato Chutney Ingredients 175g/6oz light brown sugar 150ml/5fl oz red wine vinegar 1 shallot or small onion, peeled, finely chopped 1 garlic clove, peeled, finely chopped 2cm/¾in piece fresh root ginger, peeled, finely grated 1 red chilli, finely chopped 125g/4½oz sultanas 600g/1lb 5oz green tomatoes, quartered Method Heat the sugar in a frying pan until the sugar melts and caramelises.</description>

      <description>Introduction As part of the Questionnaire Maker plugin it is necessary to create a pdf report. The best tool to do this appears to be TCPDF, which appears to be part of at least some Linux distributions as php-tcpdf. It is not included in WordPress.&#xA;Implementation As both the plugin and TCPDF are hosted on GitHub, the best way to implement the plugin, and TCPDF if it is not available on the web server, is to clone the repositories and use symbolic links to provide the plugin and the library in the right places.</description>

      <description>CALMU Smart meters are not a new idea. I was a member of a project in the early 1980s which designed and rolled out a prototype smart meter which was far ahead of it&amp;rsquo;s time. The unit was called a CALMU (Credit and Load Management Unit). It was capable of recording electricity consumption with several tariffs, gas consumption, with a connection to a suitable gas meter and water use, with a connection to a suitable water meter.</description>

      <description>Many years ago one of my brothers&amp;rsquo; friends brought me a faulty military surplus valve amplifier which used 807 valves for the output. It appeared to have suffered a flashover which had destroyed much of the wiring and components inside the chassis, but the tagboards appeared to be reusable.&#xA;I had a copy of a Mullard amplifier book, Mullard Circuits for Audio Amplifiers at the time, which I subsequently lent so someone who never returned it.</description>

      <description>I have a windows app where I want the app window to maintain it&amp;rsquo;s aspect ratio when it is resized. Windows provides two mechanisms for this, the WM_SIZE message and the WM_SIZING message. The WM_SIZE message is sent when a window has been resized to allow child windows to be resized, the WM_SIZING message is sent while the user is resizing it to allow the size to be adjusted. The messages are handled in the WindowProc callback function.</description>

One of them had a novel way of preparing tomatoes for an English breakfast.&#xA;Ingredients Tomatoes Oregano Olive oil Method Take the stems off the tomatoes and place them upside down in a baking tin. They should be stable upside down. Cut a cross in the bottom of each one, put a few drops of oil on each one and sprinkle over some oregano.</description>

      <description>Just a more interesting way of preparing mushrooms than chopping them up.&#xA;Ingredients Mushrooms Olive oil Method Keep the mushrooms whole, even if they have long stems. Put some oil in a skillet over a medium heat and place the mushrooms cap down in the pan with the stems sticking up. Add a couple of drops of oil to the inside of the cap of each mushroom. When the caps are browned tip them on their sides or turn them over depending on the length of the stems.</description>

A meal for four.&#xA;Ingredients Tin of corned beef Tin of red beans Tin of chopped tomatoes Packet of chili mix Olive oil Method Warm up a large skillet over a gentle heat with some olive oil and add the corned beef, breaking it up into chunks When the corned beef has warmed through, add the chili mix and the tin of tomatoes Stir gently, drain the tin of red beans and add to the pan Allow to simmer, stirring to prevent sticking, until well heated through Meanwhile, cook a pot of boiled rice Serve with the rice and possibly some mango chutney </description>

      <description>I got myself a refurbished Moto G phone a while ago. It came with Android Kitkat 4.4.4, complete with Moto bloat. I had already put Cyanogenmod on my tablet, so I installed Cyanogenmod 11, android 4.4.4 on it, in accordance with the instructions on the wiki, no problem. That got rid of the bloat and allows fine control of app snooping via Privacy Guard in the settings.&#xA;When I first installed Cyanogenmod, I had to use an unofficial build, as an official build for Kitkat 4.</description>

      <title>Replacing microbore radiators</title>

      <description>My heating system uses 1/4″ copper pipe, which I think was called microbore at the time. Both pipes went to a valve at one end of the radiator. There were a variety of valves fitted, but most of them were like this one.&#xA;I investigated the best method for replacing the radiators and valves and found that using standard 15mm fittings with 15/8mm reducers was probably the best option. This involves removing the old radiator and valve, carefully removing the olives from the existing pipes with a junior hacksaw to cut a slot, and a screwdriver to pry it off.</description>

      <description>I didn’t like the Windows 10 preview, I thought it was a pain in the backside, so I have delayed upgrading from Windows 7 until the last minute when I got the countdown notification. I have been running a slightly dodgy copy of Windows 7 for a long time, so I was somewhat surprised when, out of the goodness of their hearts, Microsoft said I could have an activated copy of Windows 10 for free.</description>

      <description>This is from a transport caff near the village of Pissouri, Cyprus many years ago. The pods need to be picked before the beans have fully developed and before the pods have grown a tough membrane around the beans. I have not seen beans this young for sale.&#xA;Ingredients Young broad bean pods, Olive oil Method Wash and trim the bean pods and put in a suitably sized saucepan Add a glug of olive oil, cover and place on a low heat for about 10 minutes or so The pods will become soft and possibly brown a little depending on the heat The transport caff served a bowl of these as a meal in it’s own right.</description>

      <description>When I got fed up with Windows XP on my netbook, I tried windows 7 on it, but it was barely usable. So I tried Windows 7 Starter which was better. I upgraded it to Home Premium, which was OK at first, but slowed down as it got clagged up with updates.&#xA;That was it until recently, when I read an article about putting Windows 10 on one. I didn’t try that, but I did try Linux Mint on it.</description>

      <description>You will need to install the Xcode command line tools, you don’t need the Xcode app. The easiest way to do this is to attempt to build an app like emacs by typing ./configure on the command line. A dialog box will pop up asking if you want to download and install the tools.&#xA;Xcode now uses the LLVM CLang compiler and documentation is exceedingly hard to find. You can type gcc -help or clang -help on the command line to get some info.</description>

      <description>You will need to install Calibre to make the books usable, and the books must be DRM free.&#xA;There are two ways to do this:&#xA;If you have a Mac or Hackintosh you can find your books in ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks/Books, in what appears to be epub files but are really folders with numeric names. Copy the ones you want to somewhere accessible, like ~/Books, and zip the contents of each folder, not the folder itself.</description>

      <description>I recently added a new disk drive to my workstation and, as part of reorganising, wanted to move the Linux Mint root partition from one disk to another. Naturally I googled duckied it and found a certain amount of useful info.&#xA;I used gnuparted to copy the partition from one disk to another. The standard method to reinstall grub on a partition so it will boot appears to be to mount it and use grub-install with the –boot-directory option like this.</description>

      <description>Back in the mid 70’s, I had to do some work at Kingston upon Thames Power Station. When I stopped for lunch, I found a little Greek restaurant opposite in a parade of shops and restaurants. That whole area, including the power station has since been redeveloped, and bears no resemblance. I had their lunch time offer of pan fried kidneys, probably with rice.&#xA;When I got home, I mentioned this to she who did most of the cooking at that time and she came up with something which became her kidney special.</description>

      <description>Using a handler to return results from a worker thread This has taken me quite a while to put together. There are throw-away remarks in the Android docs about this, but no useful examples. You want to get the results back from a worker thread to your main activity so you can do stuff with them. There are several parts to this.&#xA;The main activity implements Handler.Callback, and has a handleMessage function.</description>

      <description>This recipe is based on the mutton in a pot in this episode of Italy Unpacked. I have converted it to a slow cooker recipe, but it could be done in a casserole in the oven or in a earthenware pot next to a wood fire. Some of the ingredients are a compromise, for example Giorgio bought a kilo of rocket in the market. I couldn’t have got all that in the pot.</description>

      <description>I wrote a java tuner app a few years ago, so I needed a Fast Fourier Transform to do the frequency detection. I found a fairly simple implementation in java on the web somewhere, can’t remember where, tried it, and it worked fine. The frequency detection algorithm comes from The Dsp Dimension.&#xA;A few years later I ported it to windows, added a few gizmos for tuning accordions and put it on Google Code.</description>

      <description>This recipe is based on the sausages with lentils in this episode of Italy Unpacked on BBC 2. This is enough for three or four, depending on the number of sausages. You will need a medium sized pan to cook the lentils, and a large deep pan for the sausages, onions, and everything else.&#xA;Ingredients One cup green lentils Two sticks celery, chopped Large garlic clove or two small, chopped Six or eight good quality sausages Two large onions, chopped 500g carton passata Olive oil Method Put lentils, chopped celery and garlic in a pot, cover with water, boil for five minutes, then simmer for about 30 minutes until tender.</description>

      <description>I made a vow about 20 years ago not to attempt to learn C++, when a colleague went on a C++ course. I did buy a C++ book, but it wasn’t that useful. I have looked at the source of various C++ programs over the years to attempt to find out how they worked. I have, until recently, invariably found that the code that does something useful is either hidden in include files, or buried so deep in obscure code that just seems to create and do strange things with various objects, that I have been unable to find it.</description>

      <description>I find Java Collections frustrating and insane. I have been through this loop on several occasions. I decide I want a list to do whatever. So I look up List in the docs and find it’s an interface, ie: roll yer own. So I look down the hierarchy and find AbstractList, which is abstract, again: roll yer own. So finally I get to ArrayList which might do the job, but the docs aren’t too clear, so I try it and it works.</description>

You will also find a healthy disregard of the cleaning up operation afterwards. Usually most of this nonsense can be safely ignored and locally available ingredients used instead, and the recipe converted from an N-pot recipe to a one-pot recipe.</description>

This blog explains a method using Chrome to spoof the user agent string, pretending to be an iPad. Unfortunately, this doesn’t seem to work any more in the latest version of Chrome.&#xA;So I tried installing a user agent spoofing plugin in Firefox. It seemed to work, but the video didn’t play, so I couldn’t find the url.</description>

      <description>I have written several applications in both Java and C that involve running an audio thread in the background to read or write audio from or to the audio system while displaying the results and interacting with the user in the foreground. I have used lots of threads, but never a semaphore or mutex apart from the odd boolean variable.&#xA;This issue is reminiscent of back in the day when you actually had or could get a circuit diagram of your computer and could understand it.</description>

      <description>This site has the firewall set up so that the web server has no external access. This means that I can’t use the usual WordPress update mechanism to keep it up to date. I use FileZilla for maintaining the server, and I recently discovered you can use drag and drop to move stuff around remotely.&#xA;So my easy WordPress upgrade method is:&#xA;Download the latest zip file and unzip it. Rename the wordpress folder to something else, like wordpress-old.</description>

      <description>When I was a teenager the chippy at Preston, Weymouth, Dorset used to serve faggots and peas with gravy in those aluminium foil containers that take-away Chinese used to come in. Enough for 2.&#xA;Ingredients 3-5 faggots Frozen or fresh peas Truly Evil Onion Gravy Method Start the gravy first as it takes a while to render the onions down. Once the onions are well done, put the faggots in a tin and place in a medium hot oven – 180° C, until they are starting to brown.</description>

      <description>I read an article recently about how amazingly efficient functional programming, and Haskell in particular is. So I thought I’s give it a go and see how I got on.&#xA;You can try it out in your browser: http://tryhaskell.org&#xA;λ let factorial n = product [1..n] in factorial 99 9332621544394415268169923885626670049071596826438162146859 2963895217599993229915608941463976156518286253697920827223 7582511852109168640000000000000000000000 :: (Enum a, Num a) =&amp;gt; a λ Pretty impressive!

      <description>This is an adaptation of a recipe I saw recently in the Metro. Not Huevos Rancheros, but something else. The original recipe was most insistent that the black pepper be added to the pan, not the eggs, and the eggs should be stirred, not beaten.&#xA;Ingredients Small potato, chopped Small onion, chopped Chili pepper, sliced Chorizo, chopped Tomato, chopped Fresh ground black pepper 2 eggs Oil Method Put some oil in a medium sized skillet or frying pan and warm up.</description>

      <description>When I first set up this web site, I looked for a simple web analytics program so that I could see if anyone actually looked at it. After faffing about with a couple of well known open source packages, I decided that they were way over the top by several orders of magnitude. Then I found SlimStat. However it appears to be no longer actively maintained, which it why the previous link is via the Way Back Machine.</description>

      <description>When I got my Pi some months ago I bought a wifi adapter for it, as you do. But I couldn’t get it to work reliably in Raspbian, and I didn’t even try in Arch Linux. So I tested the adapter on my windoze box, and it worked just fine, and I tried it with Linux and it worked just fine, so I put it in the ‘too hard’ box.</description>

      <description>I’ve studiously avoided Python up till now, even though it appears to be fairly popular, because it violates the first law of compiler design: ‘Blank space shalt not be significant except to separate tokens where necessary.’. That’s why you can minimise a lengthy JavaScript script like jQuery to one enormously long line and it still works just fine.&#xA;But, she-who-shall-be-ignored (self categorisation) decided she wanted to enter an advent calender competition which involved checking a web page to see if your name has come up and sending an email if it does.</description>

      <description>Introduction Whatever-o-meter is a WordPress and Hugo plugin that shows a tachometer-like dial with a pointer, asks a series of predefined questions which are answered by moving a slider, shows one of several predefined results, and moves the tacho pointer to a position determined by the value of the result. The project is on Github.&#xA;Documentation Whatever-o-meter uses the shortcode [whatever-o-meter] or {{&amp;lt;whatever-o-meter&amp;gt;}} to insert the whatever-o-meter display into the page.</description>
