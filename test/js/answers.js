Neither is right or wrong but your natural type will affect how you want to run and show up in your business.\n\nYour C Type is your communication style. How do you prefer to interact with others? Does interaction with others fuel or drain you? Knowing this and working with your natural type will enable you to work better with other people and manage your own energy in a way that supports you.\n\nYour D Type describes how you prefer to draw influence in your work. Is it your natural tendency to innovate or do you prefer to rely on time-tested methods? Both are options inside of business and the same as with the other types, expecting something different of yourself will not serve you.\n\nYour E Type is your execution style. What role do you want to take as a business owner? Do you want to implement or do you want an advisory role. It is possible to build strong, profitable businesses in either and it's important to know your natural preference.\n\nYour F Type describes your natural focus point. Do you work methodically through one project at a time or do you like to have multiple projects to work on at once? This affects how you niche and how you run your business so that it works for you.\n\nI hope you find your design to be insightful in your business building journey!\n\n"}],

While it is true that energy flows where attention goes this does not necessarily mean you have to choose one interest and give up all the others to be successful in business.\n\nThe good news is there is likely an overarching theme that can be used to tie many of your interests together. In many cases your interests tie back to one key vision for the future or belief that you are wanting to bring to the world.\n\nYour challenge in terms of day to day in the business will be making sure that there is enough attention on one idea at a time to bring it to life.

That may well be hiring implementation support or in the beginning taking focussed time to get the detail work done so the big picture can come to life.\n\nIn terms of marketing your business you will likely enjoy using lots of different strategies to keep it interesting and get your big vision out to the world.

The good news is there is likely a thread between your varied interests that can be used to tie at least some of them together. Look for common themes and look at the reasons why they are important to you.\n\nYour challenge will be making sure that everything you want to bring into the world actually get done.

You may well want to take on a support person early in your journey so you can focus purely on the areas that you enjoy and drive the business forward.\n\nYou may experience difficulty drawing your focus away from your current favourite project so it would be a great help for you to have someone in your environment who reminds you of the bigger picture and you can bounce ideas off of to make sure that the project you are working on is indeed the best use of your time.\n\nIn terms of marketing your business you can best utilize your natural single-tasker focus by choosing one or two core marketing methods and doing them really well.\n\nTrying to be everywhere at once, or using what I call The Visibility Fallacy will cause you to burn out because it goes against your natural tendency to focus in."}}
