Does interaction with others fuel or drain you? Knowing this and working with your natural type will enable you to work better with other people and manage your own energy in a way that supports you.\n\nYour D Type describes how you prefer to draw influence in your work. Is it your natural tendency to innovate or do you prefer to rely on time-tested methods? Both are options inside of business and the same as with the other types, expecting something different of yourself will not serve you.\n\nYour E Type is your execution style. What role do you want to take as a business owner? Do you want to implement or do you want an advisory role. It is possible to build strong, profitable businesses in either and it's important to know your natural preference.\n\nYour F Type describes your natural focus point.

Your F Type affects how you niche and how you run your business so that it works for you.\n\nYou can think of your Entrepreneurial Design like your own personal operating manual.
